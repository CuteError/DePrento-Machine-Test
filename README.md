Hello there,

I've tried completing all the problem statements given in the Machine Test 1.

I have used Bootstrap 5 to build the HTML and all the components

1. Created a Carousel of 3 images with sliding.

2. Added some data into table. I included an external library (from stack overflow) to sort item "alphabetically" or "numerically". You can click on the table header to sort items.

3. Added a card element with blog id, blog title, blody description and a button to view full details. When we click on the button a centered modal appears which contains that item's description. Fetching the data from the given json and populated it into the card elements.

4. Created a feedback form with the given inputs and added a command to log the data in the console. Most of the work is done but due to time limit I'm submitting this task.

5. It was a good and exiciting assessment. ðŸ˜Š

6. looking forward to hearing back from you. ðŸ¤ž
